## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive **Ransomware Defense Playbook** inspired by real-world threats like **Babuk ransomware**. It includes lessons learned, checklists, and actionable response strategies to help security teams stay prepared.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- 🎯 Targeted service termination
- 🕵️‍♂️ Stealthy execution with low noise
- 🧨 Shadow copy deletion
- 🧬 Source code leaks = copycat variants
- 🧱 EDR bypass via legitimate tools

## 🧩 Playbook Structure

### 🔍 Detection
- YARA/Sigma rules for `.babuk` extensions
- Monitor mutexes, process injection, registry drops

### 🚨 Response
- Isolate infected systems
- Disable VPNs, preserve memory dumps
- Notify stakeholders & law enforcement

### 🔄 Recovery
- Restore from offline backups
- Rotate credentials
- Conduct root cause analysis
